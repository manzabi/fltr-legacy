    description: `Persons who score high on the
    Conscientiousness scale are, in fact, perceived by others as intelligent.
    The benefits of high conscientiousness are obvious. Conscientious
    individuals avoid trouble and achieve high levels of success through
    purposeful planning and persistence. They are also positively
    regarded by others as intelligent and reliable. On the negative
    side, they can be compulsive perfectionists and workaholics.
    Furthermore, extremely conscientious individuals might be regarded
    as stuffy and boring. Unconscientious people may be criticized for
    their unreliability, lack of ambition, and failure to stay within
    the lines, but they will experience many short-lived pleasures and
    they will never be called stuffy.`,
